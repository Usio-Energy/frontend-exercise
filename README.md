# Frontend Exercise

## Write a To-Do list application, using ReactJS

High level requirements:

- Add and remove tasks from the list. 
- Reorder tasks.
- Mark task as completed (with an X).
- Display the following message, it must be always up to date with the list: "10 out of 20 tasks completed"
- Should be responsive design.

Technical requirements:

- Write code as you normally would write for a real customer-facing application.
- Use ReactJS and any other libraries you want.
- Provide instructions on how to install and run the application.
- Document (in a text/markdown file) how you could improve the application architecture/functionality.
- If you ran out of time on any of the high level requirements, write down which you specifically did not yet implement.
